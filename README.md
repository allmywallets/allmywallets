💰 **Get all your wallet balances in the same place**, from cryptocurrency explorers to exchanges. AMW only uses public keys and
read-only API keys to display your balances, so your money is never at risk.<br />
🔔 **Be notified** when you receive or send cryptocurrencies. AMW uses push notifications so you can receive notifications
on your smartphone even when you're not using the app.<br />
🔑 **Decentralized and privacy-first**, data is stored in your browser and stays in your browser. AMW only sends refresh
messages regularly to your computer so your balances can be synced. 

AMW is a work in progress but is already usable on Chrome, on Android and Desktop.

Stay tuned, more to follow!
